=> Server side:
    The server will be running in a local machine for now.
    It manages the connection requests from multile clients, their account info, their connections.
    Acts as a mediater between clients.

=> Client side:
    They are the users that create and manage their accounts and connect with other clients.

=> Backend process when a client creates new account:
    step 1
        Program asks to enter username and create unique pswd for their account and generates unique id for them.
        Collects their username.

    step 1 [optional]
        Client can choose to create a profile by providing additional info like email, phone number, etc.
        This info is sent to server and stored in the database.

    step 2
        Sends the info as a json object ${id: ... , pswd: ..., username: ...} to server.
        Server stores the data in the local database after checking if the id is unique.
        Server sends back a success message to client.

    step 3
        Client receives the success message and stores the id and pswd in a local file for future use.

    step 4 [Connecting with other clients]
        When a client clicks add friend and enters the other client's id [if they know] or search them by username and send connection request.
        The request is sent to server which checks if the id exists in the database.
        If it exists, server forwards the request to the other client.
        The other client can accept or reject the request.

    step 5
        If accepted, both clients are added to each other's friend list in the database.
        Now, a page is created for both clients to chat with each other.
        Whenever any client send a message in that page, the message is sent to the server as an array of $[sender_id, reciever_id, time&date, message].

        Server forwards the messages between the clients.
